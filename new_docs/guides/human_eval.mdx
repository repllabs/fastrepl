## Using Rich

`HumanClassifierRich` uses `Textualize/rich` to get input in both terminal and notebook.

```python
import fastrepl

eval = fastrepl.HumanClassifierRich(
    labels={
        "POSITIVE": "given text is positive",
        "NEGATIVE": "given text is negative",
    }
)

eval.compute("Nice to meet you!")
# You will be prompted for input
```
