## Question Generation

### Local
<Tip>We recommend using `remote_runner` for question generation.</Tip>
For generating question with `local_runner`, we use `llama_index` under the hood.

```python
generator = fastrepl.QuestionGenerator(source="Hello world!")

fastrepl.local_runner(generator=generator).run()
# fastrepl.Dataset({
#     features: ['question'],
#     num_rows: 5
# })
```

### Remote
`remote_runner` for question generation has few advantages:

1. It use multiple LLMs and chunk sizes to generate **diverse dataset.**
2. It use **GPU** to run small models like Cross-Encoder, to **filter out the results.**
3. You can **spawn as many jobs as you want**, rather than staring at the terminal until it finish.
4. **(Roadmap)** `app.fastrepl.com` will provide visualization and dataset management.

<Note>You can grab a key from [here](https://app.fastrepl.com).</Note>

```python
texts = [
    "How to do great work",
    "The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that offers scope to do great work",
    "In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion. Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it. So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in.",
    "That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult. When you're young you don't know what you're good at or what different kinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not even exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at 14, most have to figure it out.",
]
```

To generate question from the above texts:

```python
import fastrepl
fastrepl.api_key = ""

generator = fastrepl.QuestionGenerator(source="\n".join(texts))
ds = fastrepl.remote_runner(generator=generator).run()
```

This can takes a while. If you can't wait, Just interrupt it.

The error message will guide you how to retrieve the result using `job_id`.

```python
print(ds["question"])
# ['Why is it often difficult for young people to find something they have an aptitude for and great interest in?']
```
